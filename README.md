# Cloud Architecture Diagrams

This repo is used to store cloud architecture diagrams for apps and cloud infrastructure I've built, and enables me to track changes via code.

We can build infrastructure as a code, why not diagrams.

I am using this tool https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/ which enables you to draw cloud system architecture in python code.

> Diagram as Code allows you to track the architecture diagram changes in any version control system.
